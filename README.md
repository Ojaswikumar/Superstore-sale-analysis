# Superstore-_Sales_Analysis-PowerBI_Report
This project uses data provided by data.world on Superstore Sales. Created a Custom Function and then column which pulled Latitude and Longitude data from Bing Maps API.This project describes a way in which we can get the latitudes and longitudes of a data by giving city as a input and can then use it to create visualization using Bubble Maps. For this Bing Maps is used. Using latitude and longitude also removes ambiguity of locations and can return results more quickly.
